## Guidance

* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

**NOTE:** *My 'Weeks' are recorded Monday to Monday. I will organise my sprints to last 1 week and also run Monday to Monday for ease of documentation. This decision was made on 14/10/21 after confusion as to when my weeks work on the project board should end.*
