# Student Testing Session Plan

This is a plan I will use to organise my testing sessions with students.

[Link back to README](../README.md)


Steps for each Student Testing Session:
1. Read Intro Script to the participant

2. Allow participant to play with the game for ~3 mins.

3. Ask the participant to build an And4 circuit

4. Ask the participant to save their And4 circuit

5. Ask the participant to load their saved And4 circuit from file.

6. Read Debreifing script (Which includes important general questions)

7. Ask further questions dependent on the participants experience.


*Note: All questions posed are impartial and do not include any bias in their wording*
