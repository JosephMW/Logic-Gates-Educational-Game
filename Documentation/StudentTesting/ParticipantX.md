# Student Testing Session â€“ Participant X

*Participant X tested the project on the version of main present on 17th February*

I used the [Testing Plan](../TESTINGPLAN.md) to organise the testing session.

[Link back to README](../../README.md)

Notes during steps 2-5 (While the participant was playing with the game):
 - Expected to be able to drag from the SpawnBar.
 - **Immediately wanted a means of deleting individual circuits**
     + I asked what means of deletion they thought would make most sense and they said: A Bin to drag circuits into.
     + Maybe also a deleteAll button (Found in the options menu).
 - They thought the switch and Light should be listed first and be clear they are not like the other circuits.
 - They gave positive feedback saying it was easy to use, intuitive, and they liked the colours/design etc.
 - The ability to rotate circuits would be nice.

How the participant found steps 3,4, and 5 (Build, save, and load an And4 circuit):
 - Built with no issues.
 - While saving the circuit there not being a cursor in the Input box was confusing.
 - I asked if they were happy it had saved - they assumed it had even though there was no feedback. Perhaps feedback is unnecessary here.
 - Loaded the circuit with no problems.

Feedback gathered from steps 6-7 (Direct Questions at the end):
 - Wires fiddly to select.
 - Colours in spawnBar may not be ideal - they hypothesised that some people may think the colours were significant/distracting but they themselves found it ok.
 - Biggest need for improvement = Deletion of circuits.
 - 'Black Box' reusable circuits would be a definite good thing if implemented.
