   abstract = {Recent policy initiatives offer cash payments to children (and often their families) to induce better health and educational choices. These policies implicitly assume that children are especially impatient (i.e., have high discount rates); however, little is known about the nature of children's patience, how it varies across children, and whether children can even make rational inter-temporal choices. This paper examines the inter-temporal choices of 5- to 16-year-old children in an artefactual field experiment. We examine their choices between varying levels of compensation received in 2 or 4 months in the future and in 0 or 2 months in the future. We find that children's choices are consistent with hyperbolic discounting, boys are less patient than girls, older children are more patient and that mathematical achievement test scores, private schooling and parent's patience are not correlated with children's patience. We also find that although more than 25% of children do not make rational inter-temporal choices within a single two-period time frame, we cannot find variables that explain this behavior other than age and standardized mathematical achievement test scores.},

   abstract = {This study explored the impact of using best practices identified in previous studies in designing age-appropriate
websites for middle and high school youth. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, 31 middle and 22 high school
youth took part in six focus groups across four states. Participants were introduced to a website specifically
designed for either middle or high school youth, asked to discuss their overall opinions of content and interface
design, and then asked to rate their overall first impressions of the site. Satisfaction ratings for both groups
increased for each design iteration (high school from 6.2 to 8.0; middle school from 6.7 to 8.25) and the results
validate previous findings that unique differences exist between middle and high school user preferences. ChiSquare tests (p=.05) suggest middle school website ratings increased significantly while high school website
ratings, which improved, remained inconclusive. The implications of the study include a youth website design
checklist for both middle and high school youth and the introduction of a new construct, concept actualization,
which reflects the need for designers to shift from adult to youth oriented paradigms when designing digital
environments through close collaboration between adult and youth designers. },
