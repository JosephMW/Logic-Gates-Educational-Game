   abstract = {Teaching agile practices has found its place in software engineering curricula in many universities across the globe. As a result, educators and students have embraced different ways to apply agile practices during their courses through lectures, games, projects, workshops and more for effective theoretical and practical learning. Practicing agile in university contexts comes with challenges for students and to counter these challenges, they perform some adaptations to standard agile practices making them effective and easier to use in university contexts. This study describes the constraints the students faced while applying agile practices in a university course taught at the University of Auckland, including difficulty in setting up common time for all team members to work together, limited availability of customer due to busy schedule and the modifications the students introduced to adapt agile practices to suit the university context, such as daily stand-ups with reduced frequency, combining sprint meetings, and rotating scrum master from team. In addition, it summarizes the effectiveness of these modifications based on reflection of the students. Recommendations for educators and students are also provided. Our findings and recommendations will help educators and students better coordinate and apply agile practices on industry-based projects in university contexts.},

   abstract = {Recent policy initiatives offer cash payments to children (and often their families) to induce better health and educational choices. These policies implicitly assume that children are especially impatient (i.e., have high discount rates); however, little is known about the nature of children's patience, how it varies across children, and whether children can even make rational inter-temporal choices. This paper examines the inter-temporal choices of 5- to 16-year-old children in an artefactual field experiment. We examine their choices between varying levels of compensation received in 2 or 4 months in the future and in 0 or 2 months in the future. We find that children's choices are consistent with hyperbolic discounting, boys are less patient than girls, older children are more patient and that mathematical achievement test scores, private schooling and parent's patience are not correlated with children's patience. We also find that although more than 25% of children do not make rational inter-temporal choices within a single two-period time frame, we cannot find variables that explain this behavior other than age and standardized mathematical achievement test scores.},

   abstract = {This study explored the impact of using best practices identified in previous studies in designing age-appropriate
websites for middle and high school youth. Utilizing a mixed-method approach, 31 middle and 22 high school
youth took part in six focus groups across four states. Participants were introduced to a website specifically
designed for either middle or high school youth, asked to discuss their overall opinions of content and interface
design, and then asked to rate their overall first impressions of the site. Satisfaction ratings for both groups
increased for each design iteration (high school from 6.2 to 8.0; middle school from 6.7 to 8.25) and the results
validate previous findings that unique differences exist between middle and high school user preferences. ChiSquare tests (p=.05) suggest middle school website ratings increased significantly while high school website
ratings, which improved, remained inconclusive. The implications of the study include a youth website design
checklist for both middle and high school youth and the introduction of a new construct, concept actualization,
which reflects the need for designers to shift from adult to youth oriented paradigms when designing digital
environments through close collaboration between adult and youth designers. },
