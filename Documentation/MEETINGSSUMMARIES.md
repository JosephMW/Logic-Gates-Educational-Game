# Meetings Summaries

This file contains summaries of all the advisor meetings throughout the course of my project.

[Link back to README](../README.md)

## 01/10/21 - Weekly Supervisor Meeting
What we spoke about:
*	My idea of the project:
    +	Have a very user-friendly UI
    +	Use Drag-and-drop components
    +	Allow user to build components (As a means of abstraction)
    +	Allow user to manually draw wires (Like train-tracks)
    +	Stretch Goals for my project:
        -	Tutorial Overlay that guides a pupil to build something
        -	Use levels which accumulate to a student having a complex circuit
    +	Technologies I will use:
        -	Unity (C#)
        -	GitHub
        -	VS Code
*	What we want from the project:
    +	Have a relatively polished item that you can use when talking to school pupils about the university

Goals for next time:
*	Consolidate Technologies
*	Begin learning Unity
    +	Ideally get a start on the project – perhaps a grid with drag-and-drop items
*	Set up dev tools such as GitHub
*	Set up documentation and share it with Chris McCaig

What we spoke about:
*	The progress I have made (found above)
*	Whether weekly/biweekly retrospectives could be beneficial
    +	Concluded yes
*	Whether User Testing could be beneficial, and worth the bother of ethics etc.
    +	Concluded yes. I would not be working with under 16s and it would be voluntary and non-dangerous so the ethics process would be simple. 
*	My goals for the next week (found below)
 
Goals for next time:
*	Complete my 2 ongoing issues
    +	Create a grid area for drag-and-drop purposes [#9](https://github.com/JosephMW/Logic-Gates-Educational-Game/issues/9)
    +	Implement drag-and-drop functionality on top of this grid area [#8](https://github.com/JosephMW/Logic-Gates-Educational-Game/issues/8)
*	Create a placeholder component for the drag-and-drop
*	Begin work on the wire system
    +	Get placeholder image for them
    +	Allow the placing of wires on the grid
    +	Allow wires to connect to each other
    +	Allow wires to connect to components?
