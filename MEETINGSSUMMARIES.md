## 01/10/21 - Weekly Supervisor Meeting
What we spoke about:
*	My idea of the project:
    +	Have a very user-friendly UI
    +	Use Drag-and-drop components
    +	Allow user to build components (As a means of abstraction)
    +	Allow user to manually draw wires (Like train-tracks)
    +	Stretch Goals for my project:
        -	Tutorial Overlay that guides a pupil to build something
        -	Use levels which accumulate to a student having a complex circuit
    +	Technologies I will use:
        -	Unity (C#)
        -	GitHub
        -	VS Code
*	What we want from the project:
    +	Have a relatively polished item that you can use when talking to school pupils about the university

Goals for next time:
*	Consolidate Technologies
*	Begin learning Unity
    +	Ideally get a start on the project â€“ perhaps a grid with drag-and-drop items
*	Set up dev tools such as GitHub
*	Set up documentation and share it with you
