# Logic-Gates-Educational-Game
Joseph Weir - 2365352

This is a repository where I will build a Logic Gates based game in Unity written in C#. 
This is for my 4th Year Solo Project for Computing Science.

The game will allow users to learn about Logic Gates in a hands-on and intuitive manner.
The gates and circuits will be drag-and-drop with wires you can draw to connect the components.
The user will be able to design circuits and save them to use later - this abstraction will allow users to create more complex circuits while keeping the UI simple.
