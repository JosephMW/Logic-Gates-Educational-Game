# Logic-Gates-Educational-Game

### Joseph Weir - 2365352

This is a repository where I will build a Logic Gates based game in Unity written in C#. 
This is for my 4th Year Solo Project for Computing Science.

The game will allow users to learn about Logic Gates in a hands-on and intuitive manner.
The gates and circuits will be drag-and-drop with wires you can draw to connect the components.
The user will be able to design circuits and save them to use later - this abstraction will allow users to create more complex circuits while keeping the UI simple.

## [Daily Log](DAILYLOG.md)
I will be keeping a Daily log to keep track of my work and make sure I am on track. This can be found at the link above.

## [Meetings Summaries](MEETINGSSUMMARIES.md)
I am recording the contents of all my meetings so that I can keep myself on track with set goals and reflect on the timeline of my work. This can be found at the link above.

## [Reference Manager](REFERENCEMANAGER.md)
I am recording all my references as the project progresses so that I can easily find useful sources that I have used in the past, and so I can give all my references when writing my dissertation to ensure there are no uncertainties around plagiarism.

## Issue Tracking & Branching Strategy
I have created a [project board](https://github.com/JosephMW/Logic-Gates-Educational-Game/projects/1) where I will log all issues. In the future I may consider a second GitHub board to track bugs. 
My process will be as follows:
*   1. Create a new Issue in the 'To do' column.
*   2. When I begin work on the issue, create a development branch from main for the work, and move the issue to the 'In progress column.
*   3. When I have finished working on the issue inside my development branch, create a pull request for my development branch into main, and move the issue to the 'Ready to Review' column. (Note that the pull request will be linked to the issue in my project board)
*   4. Read the pull request and if it looks good, merge the branch into Main, move the Issue to 'Reviewed, Merged, and Closed', and close the issue.

Note: I will directly commit into main *only* when writing documentation. All development work will be done in separate feature branches as described above.
