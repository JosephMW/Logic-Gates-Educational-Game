# Logic-Gates-Educational-Game

#### Joseph Weir - 2365352

This is a repository where I will build a Logic Gates based game in Unity written in C#. 
This is for my 4th Year Solo Project for Computing Science.

The game will allow users to learn about Logic Gates in a hands-on and intuitive manner.
The gates and circuits will be drag-and-drop with wires you can draw to connect the components.
The user will be able to design circuits and save them to use later - this abstraction will allow users to create more complex circuits while keeping the UI simple.

### [Daily Log](DAILYLOG.md)
I will be keeping a Daily log to keep track of my work and make sure I am on track. This can be found at the link above.

### [Meetings Summaries](MEETINGSSUMMARIES.md)
I am recording the contents of all my meetings so that I can keep myself on track with set goals and reflect on the timeline of my work. This can be found at the link above.

### [Reference Manager](REFERENCEMANAGER.md)
I am recording all my references as the project progresses so that I can easily find useful sources that I have used in the past, and so I can give all my references when writing my dissertation to ensure there are no uncertainties around plagiarism.
